# Contrastive-Learning-for-Financial-Market-Regime-Prediction

This project explores the potential of unsupervised contrastive learning embeddings in addressing the market regime prediction problem. In this approach, meaningful representations
of the data are learned without the use of labels. The project seeks to assess whether unsupervised contrastive learning can effectively capture latent structures in financial data,
improving classification performance in the supervised setting when data is incomplete or
missing.
