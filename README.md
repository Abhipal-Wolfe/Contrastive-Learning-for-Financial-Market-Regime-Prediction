# Contrastive-Learning-for-Financial-Market-Regime-Prediction

This project explores the potential of unsupervised contrastive learning embeddings in addressing the market regime prediction problem. In this approach, meaningful representations
of the data are learned without the use of labels. The project seeks to assess whether unsupervised contrastive learning can effectively capture latent structures in financial data,
improving classification performance in the supervised setting when data is incomplete or
missing.
